# FunBurd
**Project:** *Determinants of pleiotropy and monotonic gene dosage responses across human traits*

FunBurd is designed to test the association between variants aggregated across a gene set and a given trait. This repository contains all code and data required to reproduce the figures and statistical analyses presented in the project.

## Repository Contents

### Codes and Figures

The following scripts and data generate the main figures for the study:

- **Figure 2:** Heatmap of effect sizes for whole-body tissues and cell-type gene sets across traits.
- **Figure 3:** Dissecting pleiotropy, gene function, and genetic constraint.
- **Figure 4:** Rare and common variant architectures across complex traits.
- **Figure 5:** Gene dosage responses across traits.

### File Types

- `*.Rmd` and `*.md` files: Scripts for generating figures and statistical analyses.
- `data/`: Contains datasets necessary for reproducing the figures.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FunBurd.git
